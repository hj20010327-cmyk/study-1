            <div class="l2">Ed Sheeran was named songwriter of the year, but lost the album prize to Stormzy, with

            <div class="l3">Dave, the Streatham rapper who at just 19 has already guested with US superstar Drake, was
                awarded best contemporary song for Question Time, a seven-minute hip-hop track that criticises Theresa
                May over lack of NHS funding, military involvement in Syria, wage stagnation and more. The track also
                castigates David Cameron over Brexit (“You fucked us, resigned, then sneaked out the firing line”) and
                ponders whether Jeremy Corbyn can be an effective, honest politician.
                One particularly heartfelt verse attacks May over her handling of the Grenfell Tower disaster.
